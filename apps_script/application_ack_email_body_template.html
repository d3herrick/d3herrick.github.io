Thank you for submitting an application to the Newton Tree Conservancy’s Community Tree Planting program. If your application requested inclusion in an established neighborhood planting group, the director from the Newton Tree Conservancy who is assigned to that planting group will be in touch with you as we approach the next Planting day. You will find the Planting day of the next Community Tree Planting <a href="https://www.newtontreeconservancy.org/plantings/#upcoming">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If your application was not submitted as part of an established group, the Newton Tree Conservancy will retain your application to include it in a future planting when a planting group forms in close proximity to your address.
